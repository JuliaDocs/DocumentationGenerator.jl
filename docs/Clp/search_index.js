The following options are the most useful (and well documented):PrimalTolerance - primal feasibility tolerance (default 1e-7)\nDualTolerance - dual feasibility tolerance (default 1e-7)\nDualObjectiveLimit - when using dual simplex (where the objective is monotonically changing), terminate when the objective exceeds this limit\nMaximumIterations - terminate after performing this number of simplex iterations\nMaximumSeconds - terminate after this many seconds have passed\nLogLevel - set to 1, 2, 3, or 4 for increasing output (default 0)\nPresolveType - set to 1 to disable presolve\nSolveType - choose the solution method:\n0 - dual simplex- 1 - primal simplex\n- 3 - barrier with crossover to optimal basis\n- 4 - barrier without crossover to optimal basis\n- 5 - automaticInfeasibleReturn - set to 1 to return as soon as the problem is found to be infeasible (by default, an infeasibility proof is computed as well)"

Declination is returned in\n\nthe range +/-pi/2.\n\nThe latitude phi is pi/2 minus the angle between the Earth\'s\n\nrotation axis and the adopted zenith.  In many applications it    will be sufficient to use the published geodetic latitude of the    site.  In very precise (sub-arcsecond) applications, phi can be    corrected for polar motion.\n\nThe azimuth az must be with respect to the rotational north pole,\n\nas opposed to the ITRS pole, and an azimuth with respect to north    on a map of the Earth\'s surface will need to be adjusted for    polar motion if sub-arcsecond accuracy is required.\n\nShould the user wish to work with respect to the astronomical\n\nzenith rather than the geodetic zenith, phi will need to be    adjusted for deflection of the vertical (often tens of    arcseconds), and the zero point of ha will also be affected.\n\nThe transformation is the same as Ve = Ry(phi-pi/2)Rz(pi)Vh,\n\nwhere Ve and Vh are lefthanded unit vectors in the (ha,dec) and    (az,el) systems respectively and Rz and Ry are rotations about    first the z-axis and then the y-axis.  (n.b. Rz(pi) simply    reverses the signs of the x and y components.)  For efficiency,    the algorithm is written out rather than calling other utility    functions.  For applications that require even greater    efficiency, additional savings are possible if constant terms    such as functions of latitude are computed once and for all.\n\nAgain for efficiency, no range checking of arguments is carried\n\nout.\n\nLast revision:   2017 September 12\n\nSOFA release 2018-01-30\n\nCopyright (C) 2018 IAU SOFA Board.

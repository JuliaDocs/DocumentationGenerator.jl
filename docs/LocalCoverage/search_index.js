You need to install it withPkg.clone(\"https://github.com/tpapp/LocalCoverage.jl.git\")Generating HTML needs the genhtml utility, which is part of LCOV. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, usesudo apt install lcovNote that the code in this package assumes a reasonably recent lcov version when calling genhtml, ideally 1.13, but 1.12 should work too. This only checked when building this package, and does not prevent installation, only emits a warning. See the discussion of issue #1 for a workaround."

    "text": "(Image: Build Status)AngleBetweenVectors exports angle. angle(point1, point2) determines the angle of their separation.   The smaller of the two solutions is used.  π obtains If the points are opposed, [(1,0), (-1,0)]; so 0 <= angle(p1, p2) <= pi.This function expects two points from a 2D, 3D .. ManyD space, in Cartesian coordinates.  Tuples and Vectors are handled immediately (prefer Tuples for speed). To use another point representations, just define a Tuple constructor for it.  NamedTuples and SVectors have this already.Most software uses acos(dot(p1, p2) / sqrt(norm(p1) norm(p2)) instead.  While they coincide often; it is exceedingly easy to find cases where angle is more accurate and then, usually they differ by a few ulps. Not always."

Default is dim = 3.\nτ: The embedding lag for the delay embedding constructed from response.   Default is τ = 1.\nν: The prediction lag to use when predicting scalar values of driver   fromthe delay embedding of response.   ν > 0 are forward lags (causal; driver\'s past influences response\'s future),   and ν < 0 are backwards lags (non-causal; driver\'s\' future influences   response\'s past). Adjust the prediction lag if you   want to performed lagged ccm   (Ye et al., 2015).   Default is ν = 0, as in   Sugihara et al. (2012).   Note: The sign of the lag ν is organized to conform with the conventions in   TransferEntropy.jl, and is opposite to the convention used in the   rEDM package   (Ye et al., 2016).\nlibsize: Among how many delay embedding points should we sample time indices   and look for nearest neighbours at each cross mapping realization (of which there   are n_reps)?\nn_reps: The number of times we draw a library of libsize points from the   delay embedding of response and try to predict driver values. Equivalently,   how many times do we cross map for this value of libsize?   Default is n_reps = 100.\nreplace: Sample delay embedding points with replacement?

Must be one of the   following: :response, :driver, :none, :both.   Default is :none.\nsurr_func: A valid surrogate function from TimeseriesSurrogates.jl.\ntree_type: The type of tree to build when looking for nearest neighbors.   Must be a tree type from NearestNeighbors.jl. For now, this is either   BruteTree, KDTree or BallTree.\ndistance_metric: An instance of a Metric from Distances.jl. BallTree and BruteTree work with any Metric.   KDTree only works with the axis aligned metrics Euclidean, Chebyshev,   Minkowski and Cityblock. Default is metric = Euclidean() (note the instantiation of the metric).\ncorrespondence_measure: The function that computes the correspondence   between actual values of driver and predicted values. Can be any   function returning a similarity measure between two vectors of values.   Default is correspondence_measure = StatsBase.cor, which returns values on -1 1.   In this case, any negative values are usually filtered out (interpreted as zero coupling) and   a value of 1 means perfect prediction.   Sugihara et al.

    "text": "Julia has only recently reached v1.0 and the AbstractArray interface is still quite new. The purpose of this library is to solidify extensions to the current AbstractArray interface which are put to use in package ecosystems like DifferentialEquations.jl. Since these libraries are live, this package will serve as a staging ground for ideas before they merged into Base Julia. For this reason, no functionality is exported so that way if such functions are added and exported in a future Base Julia there will be no issues with the upgrade."

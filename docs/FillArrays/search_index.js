    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: codecov)Julia package to lazily representing matrices filled with a single entry, as well as identity matrices.  This package exports the following types: Eye, Fill, Ones, and Zeros.The primary purpose of this package is to precent a unified way of constructing matrices. For example, to construct a 5-by-5 CLArray of all zeros, one would usejulia> CLArray(Zeros(5,5))Because Zeros is lazy, this can be accomplished on the GPU with no memory transfer. Similarly, to construct a 5-by-5 BandedMatrix of all zeros with bandwidths (1,2), one would use  julia> BandedMatrix(Zeros(5,5), (1, 2))"

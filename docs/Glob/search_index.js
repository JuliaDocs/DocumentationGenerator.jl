    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: Coverage Status)This implementation of Glob is based on the IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition (Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6) for fnmatch and glob. The specification of which can be found online: fnmatch and glob.Note, because this is based on the POSIX specification, the path separator in a glob pattern is always / and the escape character is always \\. However, the returned path string will always contain the system path separator character Base.path_separator. Therefore, it may be true that a path returned by glob will fail to match a Glob.FilenameMatch constructed from the same pattern."

A leading period is a period at the beginning of a string, or a period after a slash if PATHNAME is true.\ne = NOESCAPE : Do not treat backslash (\\) as a special character (in extended mode, this only outside of [])\nd = PATHNAME : A slash (/) character must be exactly matched by a slash (/) character (not a ?, *, or [])\nx = EXTENDED : Additional features borrowed from newer shells, such as bash and tcsh\nBackslash (\\) characters in [] groups escape the next character"

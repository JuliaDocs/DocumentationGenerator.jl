    "text": "(Image: Travis Status) (Image: Appveyor status) (Image: Coverage Status)The DecFP package is a Julia wrapper around the Intel Decimal Floating-Point Math Library, providing a software implementation of the IEEE 754-2008 Decimal Floating-Point Arithmetic specification.32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit decimal floating-point types Dec32, Dec64, and Dec128, respectively, are provided.  This is very different from packages such as Decimals.jl, which provide arbitrary-precision decimal types analogous to BigFloat: arbitrary precision types are very flexible, but fixed-precision types such as those in DecFP are much faster (though still about 100x slower than the hardware binary floating-point types Float32 and Float64).The DecFP package currently requires the Julia 0.5 release or later."

    "text": "Dec64 and the other types mentioned above can be constructed from other Julia numeric types (binary floating-point or integers) via Dec64(3.5) or Dec(3), from strings by parse(Dec64, \"3.2\") or d64\"3.2\" (a Julia string macro); similarly for Dec32 and Dec128. The string macro d\"3.2\" constructs Dec64.Once a decimal float is constructed, most Julia arithmetic and special functions should work without modification.  For example, d\"3.2\" * d\"4.5\" produces the Dec64 result +1440E-2 (14.4). Most basic arithmetic functions are supported, and many special functions (sqrt, log, trigonometric functions, etc.).   Mixed operations involving decimal and binary floating-point or integer types are supported (the result is promoted to decimal floating-point).In general, you should be able to use the DecFP types in any context where you would have used binary floating-point types: arrays, complex arithmetic, and linear algebra should all work, for the most part."

The following options are likely to be the most useful:seconds – Solution timeout limit. (Must be a Float64)\nlogLevel – Set to 1 to enable solution output.\nmaxSolutions – Terminate after this many feasible solutions have been found.\nmaxNodes – Terminate after this many branch-and-bound nodes have been evaluated.\nallowableGap – Terminate after optimality gap is less than this value (on an absolute scale).\nratioGap – Terminate after optimality gap is smaller than this relative fraction.\nthreads – Set the number of threads to use for parallel branch & boundThe complete list of parameters can be found by running the cbc executable and typing  at the prompt.In addition, we provide the julia-specific option check_warmstart which, if set to false, will tell the wrapper to pass along the warmstart solution regardless of if it satisfies the constraints of the problem. The default value is true."

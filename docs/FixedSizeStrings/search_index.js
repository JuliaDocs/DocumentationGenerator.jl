    "text": "This is a string type for compactly storing short strings of statically-known size. Each character is stored in one byte, so currently only the Latin-1 subset of Unicode is supported.To use, call FixedSizeString{n}(itr), where n is the length and itr is an iterable of characters. Alternatively, other string types can be converted to FixedSizeString{n}.FixedSizeStrings works well in the following cases:Very short strings, e.g. <= 8 characters\nStoring many strings of the same length, when the number of unique strings is largeIf you have a large array with a relatively small number of unique strings, it is probably better to use PooledArrays with whatever string type is convenient.TODO and open questions:Support more characters by adding a parameter for the representation (UInt16, UInt32)\nDoes it make sense to support UTF-8?\nPossibly add MaxLengthString, which is the same except can be padded with 0 bytes to represent fewer than the maximum possible number of characters."

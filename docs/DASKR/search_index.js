You may choose them to be both scalars\nC                   or else both arrays of length NEQ.\nC\nC  IDID:OUT         This integer scalar is an indicator reporting what\nC                   the code did.

The purpose of PSOL is to solve\nC                   linear systems involving a left preconditioner P.\nC\nC  RT:EXT           This is the name of the subroutine for defining\nC                   constraint functions Ri(T,Y,Y\')) whose roots are\nC                   desired during the integration.  This name must be\nC                   declared external in the calling program.\nC\nC  NRT:IN           This is the number of constraint functions\nC                   Ri(T,Y,Y\').  If there are no constraints, set\nC                   NRT = 0, and pass a dummy name for RT.\nC\nC  JROOT:OUT        This is an integer array of length NRT for output\nC                   of root information.\nC\nC *Overview\nC\nC  The DDASKR solver uses the backward differentiation formulas of\nC  orders one through five to solve a system of the form G(t,y,y\') = 0\nC  for y = Y and y\' = YPRIME.  Values for Y and YPRIME at the initial\nC  time must be given as input.  These values should be consistent,\nC  that is, if T, Y, YPRIME are the given initial values, they should\nC  satisfy G(T,Y,YPRIME) = 0.  However, if consistent values are not\nC  known, in many cases you can have DDASKR solve for them -- see\nC  INFO(11). (This and other options are described in detail below.)\nC\nC  Normally, DDASKR solves the system from T to TOUT.  It is easy to\nC  continue the solution to get results at additional TOUT.  This is\nC  the interval mode of operation.  Intermediate results can also be\nC  obtained easily by specifying INFO(3).\nC\nC  On each step taken by DDASKR, a sequence of nonlinear algebraic\nC  systems arises.  These are solved by one of two types of\nC  methods:\nC    * a Newton iteration with a direct method for the linear\nC      systems involved (INFO(12) = 0), or\nC    * a Newton iteration with a preconditioned Krylov iterative\nC      method for the linear systems involved (INFO(12) = 1).\nC\nC  The direct method choices are dense and band matrix solvers,\nC  with either a user-supplied or an internal difference quotient\nC  Jacobian matrix, as specified by INFO(5) and INFO(6).\nC  In the band case, INFO(6) = 1, you must supply half-bandwidths\nC  in IWORK(1) and IWORK(2).\nC\nC  The Krylov method is the Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES)\nC  method, in either complete or incomplete form, and with\nC  scaling and preconditioning.  The method is implemented\nC  in an algorithm called SPIGMR.  Certain options in the Krylov\nC  method case are specified by INFO(13) and INFO(15).\nC\nC  If the Krylov method is chosen, you may supply a pair of routines,\nC  JAC and PSOL, to apply preconditioning to the linear system.\nC  If the system is A*x = b, the matrix is A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME\nC  (of order NEQ).  This system can then be preconditioned in the form\nC  (P-inverse)*A*x = (P-inverse)*b, with left preconditioner P.\nC  (DDASKR does not allow right preconditioning.)\nC  Then the Krylov method is applied to this altered, but equivalent,\nC  linear system, hopefully with much better performance than without\nC  preconditioning.  (In addition, a diagonal scaling matrix based on\nC  the tolerances is also introduced into the altered system.)\nC\nC  The JAC routine evaluates any data needed for solving systems\nC  with coefficient matrix P, and PSOL carries out that solution.\nC  In any case, in order to improve convergence, you should try to\nC  make P approximate the matrix A as much as possible, while keeping\nC  the system P*x = b reasonably easy and inexpensive to solve for x,\nC  given a vector b.\nC\nC  While integrating the given DAE system, DDASKR also searches for\nC  roots of the given constraint functions Ri(T,Y,Y\') given by RT.\nC  If DDASKR detects a sign change in any Ri(T,Y,Y\'), it will return\nC  the intermediate value of T and Y for which Ri(T,Y,Y\') = 0.\nC  Caution: If some Ri has a root at or very near the initial time,\nC  DDASKR may fail to find it, or may find extraneous roots there,\nC  because it does not yet have a sufficient history of the solution.\nC\nC *Description\nC\nC------INPUT - WHAT TO DO ON THE FIRST CALL TO DDASKR-------------------\nC\nC\nC  The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new\nC  problem.  Read through the descriptions of all the following items,\nC  provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set\nC  appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and\nC  give information about how you want the problem to be solved.\nC\nC\nC  RES -- Provide a subroutine of the form\nC\nC             SUBROUTINE RES (T, Y, YPRIME, CJ, DELTA, IRES, RPAR, IPAR)\nC\nC         to define the system of differential/algebraic\nC         equations which is to be solved. For the given values\nC         of T, Y and YPRIME, the subroutine should return\nC         the residual of the differential/algebraic system\nC             DELTA = G(T,Y,YPRIME)\nC         DELTA is a vector of length NEQ which is output from RES.\nC\nC         Subroutine RES must not alter T, Y, YPRIME, or CJ.\nC         You must declare the name RES in an EXTERNAL\nC         statement in your program that calls DDASKR.\nC         You must dimension Y, YPRIME, and DELTA in RES.\nC\nC         The input argument CJ can be ignored, or used to rescale\nC         constraint equations in the system (see Ref. 2, p. 145).\nC         Note: In this respect, DDASKR is not downward-compatible\nC         with DDASSL, which does not have the RES argument CJ.\nC\nC         IRES is an integer flag which is always equal to zero\nC         on input.  Subroutine RES should alter IRES only if it\nC         encounters an illegal value of Y or a stop condition.\nC         Set IRES = -1 if an input value is illegal, and DDASKR\nC         will try to solve the problem without getting IRES = -1.\nC         If IRES = -2, DDASKR will return control to the calling\nC         program with IDID = -11.\nC\nC         RPAR and IPAR are real and integer parameter arrays which\nC         you can use for communication between your calling program\nC         and subroutine RES. They are not altered by DDASKR. If you\nC         do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these parameters by treat-\nC         ing them as dummy arguments. If you do choose to use them,\nC         dimension them in your calling program and in RES as arrays\nC         of appropriate length.\nC\nC  NEQ -- Set it to the number of equations in the system (NEQ .GE. 1).\nC\nC  T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration. (T must be\nC       a variable.)\nC\nC  Y(*) -- Set this array to the initial values of the NEQ solution\nC          components at the initial point.  You must dimension Y of\nC          length at least NEQ in your calling program.\nC\nC  YPRIME(*) -- Set this array to the initial values of the NEQ first\nC               derivatives of the solution components at the initial\nC               point.  You must dimension YPRIME at least NEQ in your\nC               calling program.\nC\nC  TOUT - Set it to the first point at which a solution is desired.\nC         You cannot take TOUT = T.  Integration either forward in T\nC         (TOUT .GT. T) or backward in T (TOUT .LT. T) is permitted.\nC\nC         The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using step\nC         sizes which are automatically selected so as to achieve the\nC         desired accuracy.  If you wish, the code will return with the\nC         solution and its derivative at intermediate steps (the\nC         intermediate-output mode) so that you can monitor them,\nC         but you still must provide TOUT in accord with the basic\nC         aim of the code.\nC\nC         The first step taken by the code is a critical one because\nC         it must reflect how fast the solution changes near the\nC         initial point.  The code automatically selects an initial\nC         step size which is practically always suitable for the\nC         problem.  By using the fact that the code will not step past\nC         TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary, restrict the\nC         length of the initial step.\nC\nC         For some problems it may not be permissible to integrate\nC         past a point TSTOP, because a discontinuity occurs there\nC         or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond\nC         TSTOP.  When you have declared a TSTOP point (see INFO(4)\nC         and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate past\nC         TSTOP.  In this case any tout beyond TSTOP is invalid input.\nC\nC  INFO(*) - Use the INFO array to give the code more details about\nC            how you want your problem solved.  This array should be\nC            dimensioned of length 20, though DDASKR uses only the\nC            first 15 entries.  You must respond to all of the following\nC            items, which are arranged as questions.  The simplest use\nC            of DDASKR corresponds to setting all entries of INFO to 0.\nC\nC       INFO(1) - This parameter enables the code to initialize itself.\nC              You must set it to indicate the start of every new\nC              problem.\nC\nC          **** Is this the first call for this problem ...\nC                yes - set INFO(1) = 0\nC                 no - not applicable here.\nC                      See below for continuation calls.  ****\nC\nC       INFO(2) - How much accuracy you want of your solution\nC              is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL.\nC              The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars.\nC              To obtain more flexibility, they can both be arrays.\nC              The code must be told your choice.\nC\nC          **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...\nC                yes - set INFO(2) = 0\nC                      and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL\nC                 no - set INFO(2) = 1\nC                      and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL ****\nC\nC       INFO(3) - The code integrates from T in the direction of TOUT\nC              by steps.  If you wish, it will return the computed\nC              solution and derivative at the next intermediate step\nC              (the intermediate-output mode) or TOUT, whichever comes\nC              first.  This is a good way to proceed if you want to\nC              see the behavior of the solution.  If you must have\nC              solutions at a great many specific TOUT points, this\nC              code will compute them efficiently.\nC\nC          **** Do you want the solution only at\nC               TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ...\nC                yes - set INFO(3) = 0 (interval-output mode)\nC                 no - set INFO(3) = 1 (intermediate-output mode) ****\nC\nC       INFO(4) - To handle solutions at a great many specific\nC              values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past\nC              TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT.\nC              Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some\nC              point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is\nC              not defined past TSTOP.  Then you must tell the code\nC              this stop condition.\nC\nC           **** Can the integration be carried out without any\nC                restrictions on the independent variable T ...\nC                 yes - set INFO(4) = 0\nC                  no - set INFO(4) = 1\nC                       and define the stopping point TSTOP by\nC                       setting RWORK(1) = TSTOP ****\nC\nC       INFO(5) - used only when INFO(12) = 0 (direct methods).\nC              To solve differential/algebraic systems you may wish\nC              to use a matrix of partial derivatives of the\nC              system of differential equations.  If you do not\nC              provide a subroutine to evaluate it analytically (see\nC              description of the item JAC in the call list), it will\nC              be approximated by numerical differencing in this code.\nC              Although it is less trouble for you to have the code\nC              compute partial derivatives by numerical differencing,\nC              the solution will be more reliable if you provide the\nC              derivatives via JAC.  Usually numerical differencing is\nC              more costly than evaluating derivatives in JAC, but\nC              sometimes it is not - this depends on your problem.\nC\nC           **** Do you want the code to evaluate the partial deriv-\nC                atives automatically by numerical differences ...\nC                 yes - set INFO(5) = 0\nC                  no - set INFO(5) = 1\nC                       and provide subroutine JAC for evaluating the\nC                       matrix of partial derivatives ****\nC\nC       INFO(6) - used only when INFO(12) = 0 (direct methods).\nC              DDASKR will perform much better if the matrix of\nC              partial derivatives, dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME (here CJ is\nC              a scalar determined by DDASKR), is banded and the code\nC              is told this.  In this case, the storage needed will be\nC              greatly reduced, numerical differencing will be performed\nC              much cheaper, and a number of important algorithms will\nC              execute much faster.  The differential equation is said\nC              to have half-bandwidths ML (lower) and MU (upper) if\nC              equation i involves only unknowns Y(j) with\nC                             i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU .\nC              For all i=1,2,...,NEQ.  Thus, ML and MU are the widths\nC              of the lower and upper parts of the band, respectively,\nC              with the main diagonal being excluded.  If you do not\nC              indicate that the equation has a banded matrix of partial\nC              derivatives the code works with a full matrix of NEQ**2\nC              elements (stored in the conventional way).  Computations\nC              with banded matrices cost less time and storage than with\nC              full matrices if  2*ML+MU .lt. NEQ.

Setting RTOL = 0. results in a pure\nC               absolute error test on that component.  A mixed test\nC               with non-zero RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a\nC               relative error test when the solution component is\nC               much bigger than ATOL and to an absolute error test\nC               when the solution component is smaller than the\nC               threshold ATOL.\nC\nC               The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an\nC               accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used.  It\nC               will advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and\nC               inform you as to the maximum accuracy it believes\nC               possible.\nC\nC  RWORK(*) -- a real work array, which should be dimensioned in your\nC               calling program with a length equal to the value of\nC               LRW (or greater).\nC\nC  LRW -- Set it to the declared length of the RWORK array.

It is to have the form\nC             SUBROUTINE RT(NEQ, T, Y, YP, NRT, RVAL, RPAR, IPAR)\nC             DIMENSION Y(NEQ), YP(NEQ), RVAL(NRT),\nC         where NEQ, T, Y and NRT are INPUT, and the array RVAL is\nC         output.  NEQ, T, Y, and YP have the same meaning as in the\nC         RES routine, and RVAL is an array of length NRT.\nC         For i = 1,...,NRT, this routine is to load into RVAL(i) the\nC         value at (T,Y,Y\') of the i-th constraint function Ri(T,Y,Y\').\nC         DDASKR will find roots of the Ri of odd multiplicity\nC         (that is, sign changes) as they occur during the integration.\nC         RT must be declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.\nC\nC         CAUTION.. Because of numerical errors in the functions Ri\nC         due to roundoff and integration error, DDASKR may return\nC         false roots, or return the same root at two or more nearly\nC         equal values of T.  If such false roots are suspected,\nC         the user should consider smaller error tolerances and/or\nC         higher precision in the evaluation of the Ri.\nC\nC         If a root of some Ri defines the end of the problem,\nC         the input to DDASKR should nevertheless allow\nC         integration to a point slightly past that root, so\nC         that DDASKR can locate the root by interpolation.\nC\nC NRT --  The number of constraint functions Ri(T,Y,Y\').

If nonzero, JROOT(i) shows the direction\nC         of the sign change in Ri in the direction of integration:\nC         JROOT(i) = 1  means Ri changed from negative to positive.\nC         JROOT(i) = -1 means Ri changed from positive to negative.\nC\nC\nC  OPTIONALLY REPLACEABLE SUBROUTINE:\nC\nC  DDASKR uses a weighted root-mean-square norm to measure the\nC  size of various error vectors.  The weights used in this norm\nC  are set in the following subroutine:\nC\nC    SUBROUTINE DDAWTS (NEQ, IWT, RTOL, ATOL, Y, EWT, RPAR, IPAR)\nC    DIMENSION RTOL(*), ATOL(*), Y(*), EWT(*), RPAR(*), IPAR(*)\nC\nC  A DDAWTS routine has been included with DDASKR which sets the\nC  weights according to\nC    EWT(I) = RTOL*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL\nC  in the case of scalar tolerances (IWT = 0) or\nC    EWT(I) = RTOL(I)*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL(I)\nC  in the case of array tolerances (IWT = 1).  (IWT is INFO(2).)\nC  In some special cases, it may be appropriate for you to define\nC  your own error weights by writing a subroutine DDAWTS to be\nC  called instead of the version supplied.  However, this should\nC  be attempted only after careful thought and consideration.\nC  If you supply this routine, you may use the tolerances and Y\nC  as appropriate, but do not overwrite these variables.  You\nC  may also use RPAR and IPAR to communicate data as appropriate.\nC  ***Note: Aside from the values of the weights, the choice of\nC  norm used in DDASKR (weighted root-mean-square) is not subject\nC  to replacement by the user.

You must monitor the IDID parameter in order to determine\nC     what to do next.\nC\nC     Recalling that the principal task of the code is to integrate\nC     from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need\nC     to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT.\nC\nC     Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below.  In\nC     particular do not alter NEQ, T, Y(*), YPRIME(*), RWORK(*),\nC     IWORK(*), or the differential equation in subroutine RES.  Any\nC     such alteration constitutes a new problem and must be treated\nC     as such, i.e. you must start afresh.\nC\nC     You cannot change from array to scalar error control or vice\nC     versa (INFO(2)), but you can change the size of the entries of\nC     RTOL or ATOL.  Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier\nC     to integrate.  Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation\nC     harder to integrate and should generally be aNothinged.\nC\nC     You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the\nC     interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.\nC\nC     If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going\nC     past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the\nC     code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently\nC     specified TSTOP.  Once TSTOP has been reached, you must change\nC     the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4) = 0.  You may change INFO(4)\nC     or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in\nC     RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4) = 1.\nC\nC     Do not change INFO(5), INFO(6), INFO(12-17) or their associated\nC     IWORK/RWORK locations unless you are going to restart the code.\nC\nC                    *** FOLLOWING A COMPLETED TASK ***\nC\nC     If..\nC     IDID = 1, call the code again to continue the integration\nC                  another step in the direction of TOUT.\nC\nC     IDID = 2 or 3, define a new TOUT and call the code again.\nC                  TOUT must be different from T.  You cannot change\nC                  the direction of integration without restarting.\nC\nC     IDID = 4, reset INFO(11) = 0 and call the code again to begin\nC                  the integration.  (If you leave INFO(11) > 0 and\nC                  INFO(14) = 1, you may generate an infinite loop.)\nC                  In this situation, the next call to DDASKR is\nC                  considered to be the first call for the problem,\nC                  in that all initializations are done.\nC\nC     IDID = 5, call the code again to continue the integration in the\nC                  direction of TOUT.  You may change the functions\nC                  Ri defined by RT after a return with IDID = 5, but\nC                  the number of constraint functions NRT must remain\nC                  the same.  If you wish to change the functions in\nC                  RES or in RT, then you must restart the code.\nC\nC                    *** FOLLOWING AN INTERRUPTED TASK ***\nC\nC     To show the code that you realize the task was interrupted and\nC     that you want to continue, you must take appropriate action and\nC     set INFO(1) = 1.\nC\nC     If..\nC     IDID = -1, the code has taken about 500 steps.  If you want to\nC                  continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code again.\nC                  An additional 500 steps will be allowed.\nC\nC\nC     IDID = -2, the error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been increased\nC                  to values the code estimates appropriate for\nC                  continuing.  You may want to change them yourself.\nC                  If you are sure you want to continue with relaxed\nC                  error tolerances, set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code\nC                  again.\nC\nC     IDID = -3, a solution component is zero and you set the\nC                  corresponding component of ATOL to zero.  If you\nC                  are sure you want to continue, you must first alter\nC                  the error criterion to use positive values of ATOL\nC                  for those components corresponding to zero solution\nC                  components, then set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code\nC                  again.\nC\nC     IDID = -4  --- cannot occur with this code.\nC\nC     IDID = -5, your JAC routine failed with the Krylov method.  Check\nC                  for errors in JAC and restart the integration.\nC\nC     IDID = -6, repeated error test failures occurred on the last\nC                  attempted step in DDASKR.  A singularity in the\nC                  solution may be present.  If you are absolutely\nC                  certain you want to continue, you should restart\nC                  the integration.  (Provide initial values of Y and\nC                  YPRIME which are consistent.)\nC\nC     IDID = -7, repeated convergence test failures occurred on the last\nC                  attempted step in DDASKR.  An inaccurate or ill-\nC                  conditioned Jacobian or preconditioner may be the\nC                  problem.  If you are absolutely certain you want\nC                  to continue, you should restart the integration.\nC\nC\nC     IDID = -8, the matrix of partial derivatives is singular, with\nC                  the use of direct methods.  Some of your equations\nC                  may be redundant.  DDASKR cannot solve the problem\nC                  as stated.  It is possible that the redundant\nC                  equations could be removed, and then DDASKR could\nC                  solve the problem.  It is also possible that a\nC                  solution to your problem either does not exist\nC                  or is not unique.\nC\nC     IDID = -9, DDASKR had multiple convergence test failures, preceded\nC                  by multiple error test failures, on the last\nC                  attempted step.  It is possible that your problem is\nC                  ill-posed and cannot be solved using this code.  Or,\nC                  there may be a discontinuity or a singularity in the\nC                  solution.  If you are absolutely certain you want to\nC                  continue, you should restart the integration.\nC\nC     IDID = -10, DDASKR had multiple convergence test failures\nC                  because IRES was equal to -1.  If you are\nC                  absolutely certain you want to continue, you\nC                  should restart the integration.\nC\nC     IDID = -11, there was an unrecoverable error (IRES = -2) from RES\nC                  inside the nonlinear system solver.  Determine the\nC                  cause before trying again.\nC\nC     IDID = -12, DDASKR failed to compute the initial Y and YPRIME\nC                  vectors.  This could happen because the initial\nC                  approximation to Y or YPRIME was not very good, or\nC                  because no consistent values of these vectors exist.\nC                  The problem could also be caused by an inaccurate or\nC                  singular iteration matrix, or a poor preconditioner.\nC\nC     IDID = -13, there was an unrecoverable error encountered inside\nC                  your PSOL routine.

This may be due to ill-conditioning\nC                  in the iteration matrix, or a singularity in the\nC                  preconditioner (if one is being used).\nC                  Another possibility is that there is a better\nC                  choice of Krylov parameters (see INFO(13)).\nC                  Possibly the failure is caused by redundant equations\nC                  in the system, or by inconsistent equations.\nC                  In that case, reformulate the system to make it\nC                  consistent and non-redundant.\nC\nC     IDID = -15,..,-32 --- Cannot occur with this code.\nC\nC                       *** FOLLOWING A TERMINATED TASK ***\nC\nC     If IDID = -33, you cannot continue the solution of this problem.\nC                  An attempt to do so will result in your run being\nC                  terminated.\nC\nC  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\nC\nC***REFERENCES\nC  1.

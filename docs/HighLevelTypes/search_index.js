    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: codecov) (Image: Join the chat at https://gitter.im/realopt/Scanner.jl)The goal of HighLevelTypes.jl is to relieve the user from having to answer the question that we often face. Should this be a concrete or abstract type? This question is important because both have their own limitations.For concrete types: Any behavior defined using concrete types can not be inherited.  Sometimes you even don\'t know whether you will have in the future a specialization of your type or not. Take for example the case of Diagonal matrices defined here. Assume someone works with diagonal matrices such that all elements of a matrix are taking only 3 values. It is natural to create a new type that additionally stores those values. But since all the functions were defined for the concrete type Diagonal, it is not possible to reuse this behavior. And as you know, inheriting behavior is much more important than inheriting fields.\nFor abstract types: If there is a field that would naturally fit in the abstract type, its definition needs to be delayed until the definition of the concrete types. This second issue is probably less important than the first one, although for some cases it makes the code really awkward.As a high level language, Julia deserves a high level type. doesn\'t it? "

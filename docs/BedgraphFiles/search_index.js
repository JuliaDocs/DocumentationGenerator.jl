    "text": "To read a Bedgraph file into a DataFrame, use the following Julia code:using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, DataFrames\n\ndf = DataFrame(load(\"data.bedgraph\"))The call to load returns a struct that is an IterableTable.jl, so it can be passed to any function that can handle iterable tables, i.e. all the sinks in IterableTable.jl. Here are some examples of materialising a Bedgraph file into data structures that are not a DataFrame:using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, DataTables, IndexedTables, Gadfly\n\n# Load into a DataTable\ndt = DataTable(load(\"data.bedgraph\"))\n\n# Load into an IndexedTable\nit = IndexedTable(load(\"data.bedgraph\"))\n\n# Plot directly with Gadfly\nplot(load(\"data.bedgraph\"), x=:a, y=:b, Geom.line)"

    "page": "Readme",
    "title": "Using the pipe syntax",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Both load and save also support the pipe syntax. For example, to load a Bedgraph file into a DataFrame, one can use the following code:using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, DataFrame\n\ndf = load(\"data.bedgraph\") |> DataFrameTo save an iterable table, one can use the following form:using FileIO, BedgraphFiles, DataFrame\n\ndf = # Aquire a DataFrame somehow\n\ndf |> save(\"output.bedgraph\")The pipe syntax is especially useful when combining it with Query.jl queries, for example one can easily load a Bedgraph file, pipe it into a query, then pipe it to the save function to store the results in a new file."

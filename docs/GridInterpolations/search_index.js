    "text": "(Image: Build Status) (Image: Coverage Status)This package performs multivariate interpolation on a rectilinear grid. At the moment, it provides implementations of multilinear and simplex interpolation. As of benchmarks in December 2016, multilinear interpolation performs fastest and with the most accuracy.The following image visualizes grid-based interpolation in two dimensions, with shape of interpolater for (−0.3,0.8) inscribed. The small dots reﬂect the interpolation\'s estimate for sin(x)+2cos(y)+sin(5xy), which is the underlying reward function approximated by the large dot lattice.(Image: Illustration of performance of multilinear and simplex interpolation methods)For a description of multilinear and simplex interpolation see: Scott Davies, Multidimensional Triangulation and Interpolation for Reinforcement Learning, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1997. pdfThere are some related packages, such as Grid.jl and Interpolations.jl.

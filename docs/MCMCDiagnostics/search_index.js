    "text": "This package contains two very useful diagnostics for Markov Chain Monte Carlo:potential_scale_reduction(chains...), which estimates the potential scale reduction factor, also known as Rhat, for multiple scalar chains,\neffective_sample_size(chain), which calculates the effective sample size for scalar chains.These are intended as building blocks, to be used by other libraries, and were organized into a separate library for testing and DRY."

In practice, a <50-100 lags are usually sufficient for reasonable samplers, so the “naive” version may be more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

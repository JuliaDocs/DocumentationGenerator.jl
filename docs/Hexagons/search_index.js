The following are currently provided:HexagonAxial(q, r)\nHexagonCubic(x, y, z)\nHexagonOffsetOddR(q, r)\nHexagonOffsetEvenR(q, r)One indexing system can be converted to another with convert.convert(HexagonOffsetOddR, HexagonAxial(2, 4))The six points (in cartesian space) of a hexagon can be iterated through with points.for (x, y) in vertices(HexagonAxial(2, 3))\n    # ...\nendThe center point can be obtained with centerx, y = center(HexagonAxial(2, 3))A point in cartesian space can be mapped to the index of the hexagon that contains it with the cube_round function.h = cube_round(23.5, 4.67)"
